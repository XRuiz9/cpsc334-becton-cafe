# Drips and Drops

I made this light installation for Becton Cafe's light display for module 1 of the Creative Embedded Systems class of Fall 2019. I wanted to emulate an external space that the viewer is enclosed within, as if they were looking out of a glass enclosure. Seeing how Becton Cafe is primarily used as a relaxed, quite study space, I wanted to recreate one of my favorite relaxing settings: A rainy day! To further the viewer's sense of safety within the enclosure, I've made the raining liquid flood the entire screen, thus lighting the entire space.

## Install It Yourself!

In order to use this program in your own video displays (though it is important to note that it is optimized for the Becton Cafe light display) you'll need the following:

- A Raspberry Pi (I used the 3B+)
- An HDMI Cable (There is one provided in Becton Cafe)
- A power cable (Either Micro-USB to USB-B or Micro-USB to AC Adapter)
